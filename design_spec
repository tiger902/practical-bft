Server ID, called m
- a number in the range (0, R] where R is the total number of servers

R
- the number of servers that make up the system

F
- the number of servers that can fail plus the number of malicious servers that can be tolerated by the system

R = 3F + 1



Roadmap
1. Have a full protocol using labrpc and no crypography
2. Add crypography
3. Test locally and make sure it works
4. Add optimization -- make a new branch for this
4. Implement network RPC
5. Test on the network
6. Transport layer? For the summer? I don't know!!!


TODO:
1. Adding and removing servers
2. Adding the different transport layers ... this is hard and advance, so might not need
3. Adding crypography for the message
